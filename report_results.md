# Assignment 3 Report - Results Summary

## Section 3: Measuring Zero-Shot Performance

### 3.2 Zero-shot MMLU baseline (Qwen2.5-0.5B)

*   **(c) Parsing Failures:** 5 out of 14,042 model generations failed parsing (0.04%). Examples of failed parses would need to be extracted from `mmlu_baseline_results.json`.
*   **(d) Throughput:** Generation throughput was approximately **51.93 examples/second**.
*   **(e) Performance:** The zero-shot baseline achieved an accuracy of **33.65%** on the MMLU test set (calculated on 14,037 parsable examples).
*   **(f) Error Analysis:** (To be completed by analyzing incorrect predictions in `mmlu_baseline_results.json`).
