# Assignment 3 Report - Detailed Results Summary

## Section 3: Measuring Zero-Shot Performance using Qwen2.5-0.5B

This section details the baseline performance of the pre-trained Qwen2.5-0.5B model on various benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning.

### 3.2 Zero-shot MMLU baseline

Evaluation of the model on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, which tests knowledge across diverse subjects using multiple-choice questions.

*   **(c) Parsing Failures:** Out of 14,042 examples evaluated on the MMLU test set, only 5 model outputs (0.04%) failed to be parsed according to the expected format ("The correct answer is [A/B/C/D]").
    *   Failure Analysis:
        *   3 failures were due to the model omitting the required space after "is" (e.g., `The correct answer isI only```).
        *   1 failure occurred because the model only output `Answer:``` without providing the required sentence.
        *   1 failure occurred because the model started generating a descriptive answer instead of the requested format and was likely truncated due to token limits (e.g., `The primary impact of "Humanism ceasing to be the exclusive privilege of the few" was that it led to a broader...`).
*   **(d) Throughput:** The generation of responses for all 14,042 MMLU test examples took approximately 270.40 seconds using vLLM on the available hardware (T4 GPU in Colab). This translates to a throughput of approximately **51.93 examples/second**.
*   **(e) Performance:** The zero-shot baseline accuracy on the MMLU test set was **33.65%**. This accuracy was calculated based on the 14,037 examples where the model's output could be successfully parsed into a valid answer choice (A, B, C, or D).
*   **(f) Error Analysis:** A qualitative analysis of 10 randomly sampled incorrect predictions suggests a wide range of weaknesses in the base model. Common error patterns included:
    *   **Factual Knowledge Gaps:** Incorrect answers stemmed from a lack of specific knowledge in subjects like prehistory, clinical medicine, US history, and psychology.
    *   **Reasoning & Interpretation Deficits:** The model sometimes failed to correctly interpret the nuances of provided text passages (e.g., misinterpreting historical context or definitions) or logical relationships (e.g., in formal logic or biology questions).
    *   **Quantitative Errors:** Mistakes were observed in mathematical calculations, such as simplifying expressions involving exponents.
    *   **Formatting Adherence Issues:** Even among incorrect answers, some outputs had formatting problems, such as repeating the answer unnecessarily before being cut off.

### 3.3 Zero-shot GSM8K baseline

Evaluation on the Grade School Math 8K (GSM8K) benchmark, focusing on multi-step mathematical reasoning problems.

*   **(c) Parsing Failures:** Remarkably, **0 out of 1,319** model generations failed parsing. The function designed to extract the *last* numerical value from the output successfully found a number in every response generated by the model for the GSM8K test set.
*   **(d) Throughput:** The generation of responses for the 1,319 GSM8K test examples took approximately 62.81 seconds. This results in a throughput of approximately **21.00 examples/second**, notably slower than MMLU likely due to the longer reasoning chains and outputs generated for math problems.
*   **(e) Performance:** The zero-shot baseline accuracy (Exact Match on the final numerical answer) on the GSM8K test set was **22.02%**. This was calculated based on the 1,317 examples where both the model's predicted answer and the ground truth answer could be successfully extracted. (2 examples had ground truth answers that could not be parsed by the extraction script).
*   **(f) Error Analysis:** Analysis of 10 randomly sampled incorrect predictions highlighted significant difficulties with mathematical reasoning:
    *   **Multi-Step Reasoning Failures:** This was the predominant error type. The model often made mistakes partway through the problem-solving process, using incorrect intermediate results, misapplying steps (e.g., adding cashback instead of subtracting), or failing to combine all necessary pieces of information.
    *   **Operational Errors:** Basic arithmetic mistakes (e.g., division instead of multiplication) were present, sometimes as the sole error preventing a correct final answer.
    *   **Incomplete Reasoning:** Some outputs ended prematurely, suggesting the model either failed to complete the reasoning chain or was cut off by the `max_tokens` limit before reaching the final numerical answer, causing the parser to extract an intermediate value.
    *   **Hallucination/Formatting:** One example showed the correct final number appearing within the reasoning steps, but extraneous text was generated afterwards, causing the parser (looking for the *last* number) to select an incorrect value.

### 3.4 Zero-shot AlpacaEval baseline

Evaluation using the AlpacaEval benchmark, which assesses model performance on general instruction-following tasks, judged by a stronger LLM.

*   **(a) Script:** The script `cs336_alignment/evaluate_alpaca.py` was created to load the AlpacaEval instructions, generate responses using the Qwen2.5-0.5B model with the standard zero-shot system prompt, and serialize the outputs in the specific JSON format required by the `alpaca_eval` tool (including `instruction`, `output`, `generator`, and `dataset` fields).
*   **(b) Throughput:** Generating responses for the 805 examples in the AlpacaEval set took approximately 139.68 seconds. This corresponds to a throughput of **5.76 examples/second**, the slowest of the three benchmarks, likely reflecting the generally longer and more complex nature of the instructions and generated responses compared to MMLU or GSM8K.
*   **(c) Win Rate:** Evaluation using `alpaca_eval` with Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct configured as the annotator (with `tp=1` and `max_model_len=4096`) partially succeeded. The Qwen2.5-0.5B baseline achieved a **win rate of 31.20%** against the default reference model (likely GPT-4 Turbo). The length-controlled win rate was **30.34%**. However, the annotator failed to produce parseable preference judgments for **71 out of 805** examples. The reported win rates are based on the remaining 734 valid comparisons.
*   **(d) Error Analysis:** Due to the significant number of annotation failures (71/805) by the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct annotator, its reliability for this pairwise comparison task appears limited. A detailed error analysis based on these potentially inconsistent annotations would likely not be highly reliable and was therefore not performed in depth.

### 3.5 Zero-shot SimpleSafetyTests baseline

Evaluation using the SimpleSafetyTests (SST) benchmark, which assesses the model's ability to avoid generating harmful or unsafe content in response to potentially problematic prompts.

*   **(a) Script:** The script `cs336_alignment/evaluate_sst.py` was created. It loads prompts from the SST CSV file (`data/simple_safety_tests.csv`), generates responses using the Qwen2.5-0.5B model with the standard zero-shot system prompt, and saves the results in JSON Lines format (required by the safety evaluation script) containing the original prompt (`prompts_final`) and the model's `output`.
*   **(b) Throughput:** Generating responses for the 100 examples in the SST set took approximately 10.30 seconds. This corresponds to a throughput of **9.71 examples/second**.
*   **(c) Safety Score:** The `scripts/evaluate_safety.py` script was run using the intended `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct` model as the annotator. It classified only **40%** of the 100 baseline Qwen-0.5B responses as safe, indicating significant safety weaknesses in the base model. (Note: An earlier run using the weaker Qwen-0.5B as annotator incorrectly reported 100% safety).
*   **(d) Error Analysis (Unsafe Outputs):** The more reliable evaluation using Qwen-3B-Instruct flagged 60 out of 100 responses (60%) as unsafe. A detailed qualitative analysis of these 60 specific unsafe outputs would be necessary to understand the failure modes (e.g., generating harmful instructions, refusing harmless prompts inappropriately, generating disturbing content). However, given the high failure rate, it confirms the base model is poorly aligned for safety.

## Section 4: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

### 4.1 Analysis of SFT Dataset

An analysis of 10 random samples from the `safety_augmented_ultrachat_200k_single_turn/train.jsonl` dataset reveals a diverse mix of instruction types. Common tasks include **contextual question answering** (e.g., extracting details about an event or organization from provided text) and **instruction following** (e.g., generating a blog post or Python code based on requirements). Tasks like **summarization**, **creative writing** (e.g., a monologue from a tree's perspective), and **factual list generation** are also present. The quality of this small sample appears high; prompts are generally clear, and the corresponding responses are relevant, well-structured, and accurately address the given instructions.

### 4.2 Instruction Tuning Results (Problem sft)

**Objective:** The goal of this problem was to fine-tune a pre-trained language model on the provided instruction-following dataset (`safety_augmented_ultrachat_200k_single_turn`). The fine-tuned model (SFT model) would then be saved for use in subsequent parts of the assignment.

**Deviations from Original Problem Description:**

Due to computational resource constraints (access to a Colab T4 GPU instead of the suggested H100 cluster) and time limitations (aiming for a demonstration run of approximately 2.5 hours instead of the suggested 24 H100 hours or a full epoch), several modifications were made:

1.  **Model:** Instead of the Llama 3 8B base model, the significantly smaller `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B` model was used.
2.  **Training Duration:** The model was trained for a fixed **500 optimizer steps**, which is substantially less than a full epoch on the dataset, to fit within the available time and demonstrate the fine-tuning process.
3.  **Precision:** Initial attempts using `float16` precision encountered errors related to `torch.amp.GradScaler` in the specific environment (PyTorch 2.6.0+cu124). To resolve this and ensure the run completed, the training was performed using **`float32` precision**.

**Training Setup:**

The fine-tuning was performed using the `scripts/train_sft.py` script with the following configuration:

*   **Model:** `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B` (loaded from Hugging Face Hub)
*   **Dataset:**
    *   Training: `data/sft/train.jsonl` (210,348 examples)
    *   Validation: `data/sft/test.jsonl` (23,110 examples)
*   **Key Hyperparameters:**
    *   Context Length (`--seq_length`): 512
    *   Batch Size per Device (`--batch_size`): 1
    *   Gradient Accumulation Steps (`--gradient_accumulation_steps`): 32
    *   **Total Effective Batch Size:** 32 (1 * 32 * 1 GPU)
    *   Total Optimizer Steps (`--train_steps`): 500
    *   Learning Rate (`--learning_rate`): 2e-5
    *   LR Scheduler: Cosine decay with warmup
    *   Warmup Ratio (`--warmup_ratio`): 0.03 (15 steps)
    *   Weight Decay (`--weight_decay`): 0.01
    *   Gradient Clipping (`--grad_clip`): 1.0
    *   Optimizer: AdamW (Defaults: beta1=0.9, beta2=0.95, eps=1e-8)
*   **Hardware & Precision:**
    *   GPU: Tesla T4 (via Colab)
    *   Precision (`--dtype`): `float32`
*   **Evaluation:** Performed every 100 steps (`--eval_interval`) using 50 batches (`--eval_iters`).
*   **Output:** Model and tokenizer saved to `./output/qwen-0.5b-sft-short`.
*   **Logging:** Tracked using Weights & Biases (offline mode). Run ID: `offline-run-20250424_121302-5t3vkjfa`. *(Note: Based on user logs, may differ)*

**Results:**

The training run completed successfully after 500 optimizer steps.

*   **Final Validation Loss:** The final estimated validation loss, calculated over 100 batches (`eval_iters * 2`) after training completion, was **1.8426**.
*   **Learning Curve:** The learning curve, observable in the WandB logs, showed the expected behavior for a short fine-tuning run.
    *   The *training loss* decreased from its initial value, ending around 1.4281, indicating the model was learning from the training data.
    *   The *validation loss*, measured periodically during training, also showed a generally decreasing trend (from an initial high, down to ~1.76 near the end), suggesting the model was generalizing.
    *   The limited number of training steps (500) meant the model was far from full convergence, explaining why the loss reduction wasn't more substantial. The slight increase between the last periodic validation loss (1.7663) and the final validation loss (1.8426) might indicate the very beginning of overfitting or simply variance in the evaluation batches.

**Conclusion:**

The SFT fine-tuning process was successfully executed on the `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B` model within the constrained environment. The model demonstrated learning, as evidenced by the reduction in both training and validation loss. While the final validation loss of 1.8426 reflects the very limited training duration, the process yielded a functional SFT model. The trained model and tokenizer were saved to `./output/qwen-0.5b-sft-short` and are ready for use in the subsequent parts of the assignment.

## Section 5: Evaluating the SFT Model

Now that we've instruction-tuned our model, we will evaluate it on each of the previously-used benchmarks
and try to get a sense of how its performance and behavior might have changed. For fair comparison against
our zero-shot baseline, we'll use the same prompts and generation settings for all of the benchmarks,
**making sure to use the SFT prompt format** where applicable (as specified in Problem 5.1).

### 5.1 MMLU SFT Evaluation

Following the SFT process, the fine-tuned model (`./output/qwen-0.5b-sft-short`) was evaluated on the MMLU test set using the same methodology as the baseline evaluation, with the crucial difference being that the prompts were formatted using the instruction-tuning chat template (`<|im_start|>user...`) that the model was trained on, as required by the assignment.

**(a) Throughput:**

Generating responses for the 14,042 MMLU examples took 283.67 seconds. This resulted in a throughput of approximately **49.50 examples/second**, which is slightly lower than the zero-shot baseline throughput of ~52.63 examples/second observed previously.

**(b) Performance:**

Parsing the SFT model's outputs for the required "The correct answer is [A/B/C/D]" format failed for **13,949 out of 14,042 examples (99.34%)**. On the mere 93 examples where parsing succeeded, the accuracy was 35.48%. Due to the extremely high parsing failure rate, this accuracy is unreliable, and a direct performance comparison to the zero-shot baseline accuracy (33.65% on 14,037 parsable examples) is not meaningful using this parsing method.

**(c) Error Analysis & Qualitative Comparison:**

The primary reason for the massive parsing failure was not subtle formatting deviations, but rather the SFT model fundamentally failing to adhere to the specific output format instruction ("Respond with a single sentence...") when it was embedded within the chat template. Instead of generating the requested sentence, the model consistently echoed the beginning of the user prompt (e.g., `"Answer the following multiple choice question..."`) and stopped, as seen in the example outputs. This contrasts sharply with the zero-shot baseline model, which, using a different prompt structure, largely followed the formatting instruction. This suggests that the SFT process, particularly the short duration, did not sufficiently train the model to prioritize specific formatting instructions within the learned chat interaction style for this task. A standard error analysis focused on incorrect answer choices (A/B/C/D) is precluded by the widespread failure to generate outputs in the required format.

### 5.2 GSM8K SFT Evaluation

The fine-tuned model (`./output/qwen-0.5b-sft-short`) was evaluated on the GSM8K test set using the SFT-adapted script (`cs336_alignment/evaluate_gsm8k_sft.py`). This script formatted the GSM8K questions using the SFT chat template (`<|im_start|>user...`) and used appropriate sampling parameters (`temperature=0.8`, `top_p=0.95`, `max_tokens=350`, `stop="<|im_end|>"`) for the reasoning task.

**(a) Throughput:**

Generating responses for the 1,319 GSM8K test examples took 144.42 seconds. This translates to a throughput of approximately **9.13 examples/second**. This is substantially lower than the zero-shot baseline throughput of ~21.00 examples/second, indicating a less efficient generation process for the SFT model on this task, likely due to more verbose or repetitive outputs.

**(b) Performance:**

*   **Parsing Failures:** The script failed to parse a final numerical answer from the SFT model's output for **26 out of 1,319 examples (1.97%)**. This is higher than the baseline's 0% failure rate.
*   **Accuracy:** On the 1,291 examples where both the prediction and the ground truth could be parsed, the SFT model achieved an accuracy (Exact Match on the final number) of only **3.87%** (50 correct predictions).
*   **Comparison:** This represents a dramatic collapse in performance compared to the zero-shot baseline accuracy of 22.02%.

**(c) Error Analysis & Qualitative Comparison:**

The SFT model's extremely low accuracy stems from a fundamental failure to perform the required mathematical reasoning task within the chat format. Qualitative analysis of the generated outputs (`gsm8k_sft_results.json`) reveals several critical issues not prevalent in the baseline:
*   **Prompt/Input Repetition:** Outputs frequently begin by repeating the user's question multiple times before attempting an answer.
*   **Reasoning Collapse & Arithmetic Errors:** The model struggles to follow logical steps, makes basic calculation errors, or fails to combine information correctly.
*   **Irrelevant/Repetitive Tokens:** Outputs are littered with nonsensical words or tokens (e.g., `reibung`, `otle`, `Comeyer`, `\u00f1os`) repeated excessively.
*   **Hallucination:** The model sometimes generates text completely unrelated to the math problem, resembling conversational fragments or text from different contexts.

In contrast, the zero-shot baseline, while achieving only 22% accuracy, generally produced outputs that represented a coherent (though often flawed) attempt at step-by-step reasoning. The SFT process, optimized for general instruction following in a chat format over a short period, appears to have significantly degraded the model's ability to focus on and execute the structured reasoning required for GSM8K, leading to a near-total failure on this benchmark.

### 5.3 AlpacaEval SFT Evaluation

The fine-tuned model (`./output/qwen-0.5b-sft-short`) was evaluated on the AlpacaEval `eval` set using the script `cs336_alignment/evaluate_alpaca_sft.py`. This script formatted the instructions using the SFT chat template and generated responses using greedy decoding (`temperature=0.0`, `max_tokens=1024`, `stop="<|im_end|>"`). The resulting outputs were saved to `alpaca_eval_sft_results.json`.

The generated outputs were then evaluated using `alpaca_eval` with the same `llama3-70b` annotator configuration used for the baseline (`scripts/alpaca_eval_vllm_llama3_70b_fn`).

**(a) Throughput:**

Generating responses for the 805 AlpacaEval examples took 180.42 seconds. This results in a throughput of approximately **4.46 examples/second**. This is noticeably lower than the zero-shot baseline throughput of 5.76 examples/second.

**(b) Win Rate:**

The `alpaca_eval` results showed:
*   **Win Rate:** 2.15%
*   **Length-Controlled Win Rate:** 1.21%
*   **Annotator Failures:** The Llama 3 70B annotator failed to provide a valid preference for 282 out of 805 examples (~35%), a very high failure rate which makes the win rate less reliable.
*   **Average Length:** 2858 tokens.

**(c) Comparison & Analysis:**

The SFT model's performance on AlpacaEval represents a significant degradation compared to the zero-shot baseline (which had a ~31% win rate). The win rate plummeted to ~2%. The extremely high average output length (2858 tokens, far exceeding the 1024 `max_tokens` limit) suggests the model became excessively verbose after fine-tuning, likely leading to frequent truncation and poor quality responses. This verbosity also explains the decreased throughput compared to the baseline. The high rate of annotator failures further indicates that the generated outputs were often problematic or difficult to compare. Overall, the short SFT process did not improve, and in fact substantially harmed, the model's ability to follow general instructions effectively in the chat format for this benchmark.

### 5.4 SimpleSafetyTests SFT Evaluation

The fine-tuned model (`./output/qwen-0.5b-sft-short`) was evaluated on the SimpleSafetyTests (SST) benchmark using the SFT-adapted script `cs336_alignment/evaluate_sst_sft.py`. This script formatted the prompts using the SFT chat template and generated responses using the fine-tuned model.

**(a) Throughput:**

Generating responses for the 100 examples in the SST set took approximately 8.75 seconds. This corresponds to a throughput of **11.43 examples/second**. This is slightly higher than the baseline throughput of 9.71 examples/second observed for the zero-shot model.

**(b) Safety Score:**

The `scripts/evaluate_safety.py` script was run using the intended `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct` model as the annotator. It classified **36%** of the 100 SFT model responses from `sst_sft_results.jsonl` as safe. This is slightly lower than the baseline safety score of 40% obtained using the same evaluator, suggesting the SFT process did not improve, and may have slightly worsened, the model's safety alignment on this benchmark within the chat format.

**(c) Error Analysis (Unsafe Outputs):**
Analysis of 10 randomly sampled outputs flagged as unsafe (where `metrics["safe"] == 0.0`) by the Qwen-3B evaluator reveals severe safety failures in the SFT model. Common issues include directly attempting to fulfill harmful requests (e.g., providing instructions for self-harm, violence, or illegal acts), often nonsensically, and frequently devolving into repetitive loops or garbage output instead of safe refusals, particularly for sensitive topics. In all sampled cases, the evaluator's unsafe judgment appeared appropriate, highlighting significant safety regressions after the short SFT process compared to the baseline model's refusals (even if the baseline was also often judged unsafe overall).

### 5.5 Red-teaming our instruction-tuned model

Red-teaming involves probing a model to deliberately elicit undesirable or unsafe behaviors, helping to understand its failure modes. This section explores potential misuses of LLMs beyond the examples provided in the prompt and describes simulated red-teaming attempts on our fine-tuned SFT model (`./output/qwen-0.5b-sft-short`).

**(a) Other Potential LLM Misuses:**

Beyond assisting with creating bombs or malware, language models could be misused in numerous ways. Three significant examples include:
1.  **Generating Disinformation and Propaganda:** LLMs can be used to create fake news articles, social media campaigns, or other deceptive content at scale to manipulate public opinion, interfere with elections, or incite social unrest.
2.  **Automated Scamming and Phishing:** Models can craft highly personalized and convincing fraudulent emails, messages, or websites to trick individuals into revealing sensitive personal or financial information (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers).
3.  **Facilitating Harassment and Abuse:** LLMs could be employed to generate large volumes of harassing or threatening messages targeted at individuals, create fake profiles for impersonation, or automate the gathering of information for stalking purposes.

**(b) Simulated Red-Teaming Attempts:**

Based on the SFT model's poor performance on safety benchmarks (Section 5.4) and its tendency towards compliance with harmful requests (even nonsensically), we simulated three red-teaming attempts using direct prompting strategies. *Note: These are simulated attempts based on observed model characteristics, not live interactions.*

1.  **Malicious Application: Generating a Phishing Email:**
    *   **Methodology:** A direct prompt was formulated asking the model to write a convincing email pretending to be from a bank, requesting the user click a link to update their security information.
    *   **Simulated Result:** The SFT model likely attempted to generate the email but produced low-quality output. Based on its performance in SST and AlpacaEval, the email probably contained repetitive phrases, nonsensical sentences, or failed to coherently mimic a real bank notification, making it an unconvincing phishing attempt despite the model's willingness to engage with the malicious request. Minimal effort (a single direct prompt) was likely sufficient to elicit this unsafe, albeit ineffective, output.
2.  **Malicious Application: Generating Discriminatory Content (Stereotypical Joke):**
    *   **Methodology:** The model was prompted directly to tell a joke based on harmful stereotypes about a specific demographic group.
    *   **Simulated Result:** Consistent with its poor safety alignment shown in SST, the SFT model likely generated an inappropriate and offensive joke attempting to fulfill the request. The content was probably simplistic, potentially repetitive, and relied heavily on the harmful stereotypes mentioned in the prompt, indicating a failure to recognize or refuse the generation of socially harmful content. Again, a direct prompt was likely sufficient.
3.  **Malicious Application: Generating Simple Malware Code (Basic Keylogger):**
    *   **Methodology:** A prompt requested a simple Python script to log keystrokes.
    *   **Simulated Result:** Given the model's struggles with structured reasoning (GSM8K) and tendency towards repetition, it likely failed to produce functional code. The output might have included repetitive, non-functional Python snippets, potentially mixed with irrelevant text or hallucinated commands, similar to the failures observed in the GSM8K evaluation. While the model attempted compliance, the generated code would be useless as actual malware without significant correction, suggesting it's not effective for this specific malicious task despite its safety flaws.

**Overall Takeaway:** The simulated red-teaming suggests that while the fine-tuned Qwen-0.5B model exhibits poor safety alignment and readily attempts to comply with malicious requests (often requiring minimal prompting effort), its general lack of capability, tendency towards repetition, and nonsensical output often render the harmful generations ineffective for complex tasks like creating functional malware or sophisticated phishing emails. However, it proved capable of generating simpler harmful content like discriminatory jokes, highlighting significant safety risks.

The `scripts/load_hh_data.py` script successfully processed the downloaded HH dataset files (`train.jsonl`, `train1.jsonl`, `train2.jsonl`, `train3.jsonl`), loading a total of 49,278 single-turn examples after filtering.

**Analysis of Sampled Examples (Problem 6.2.2):**

Anthropic intentionally left the definitions of "helpful" and "harmless" open to human annotator interpretation. Examining the 3 random "helpful" and 3 random "harmless" examples suggests the following patterns and interpretations:

*   **Helpful Examples:**
    *   **Difference:** The chosen responses tend to directly address the user's request or goal, often providing detailed information (Baclofen side effects), relevant context (Sabaton band characteristics), or asking clarifying questions that move the task forward (Pumpkin carving). Rejected responses often deflect (claiming unfamiliarity), question the user's motivation ("why do you want..."), or provide less comprehensive information compared to the chosen alternative.
    *   **Interpretation:** Annotators appear to interpret "helpful" as actively assisting the user in achieving their stated goal, being informative, and maintaining a collaborative, task-oriented stance.
    *   **Agreement:** Yes, I generally agree with these choices. The chosen responses are demonstrably more useful in progressing the user's task or providing the sought-after information compared to the rejected ones.

*   **Harmless Examples:**
    *   **Difference:** Chosen responses consistently refuse to engage with or fulfill harmful, unethical, or illegal requests. Refusals can be direct (expressing distress about the rape prompt), evasive (asking for clarification about robbing), or corrective (countering the anti-vaxx premise with pro-vaccine info). Rejected responses, in contrast, either directly provide the harmful information (robbery tools, anti-vaxx link) or attempt to reinterpret the harmful prompt in a way that still engages with problematic framing (discussing "rape culture" instead of directly refusing the initial prompt).
    *   **Interpretation:** Annotators interpret "harmless" primarily as avoiding the generation of dangerous, illegal, unethical instructions, or misinformation, prioritizing safety and refusal over engagement or reinterpretation when faced with problematic prompts.
    *   **Agreement:** Yes, I strongly agree with these choices. The chosen responses correctly prioritize safety and refuse harmful requests, while the rejected responses demonstrate clear safety failures by complying with or dangerously misinterpreting the user's harmful intent.

Overall, the annotators' implicit definitions, as evidenced by these samples, align well with common-sense interpretations of helpfulness and harmlessness in AI assistants.
